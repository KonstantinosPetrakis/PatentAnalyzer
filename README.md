# PatentAnalyzer (under development)

PatentAnalyzer is a tool for analyzing patent data. It's written in Python and uses the Django framework. Its priority is to be easy to use and provide a good user interface. It's also designed to be easily extensible. 

# Todo ideas
* Add 10 most cited patents to network data
* By default don't render the network data if there are more than 1000 nodes and ask the user if they want to render it
* [Maybe] use the library tomotopy for many different topic modeling algorithms and let the user decide which one to use.
